# WebbleDash

WebbleDash is a small jQuery add-on to make the life of a web-developer easier.

Please include both the "main/webbledash.js" and "main/webbledash.css" in your project to use WebbleDash correctly. Use the files inside the "main directory" when you are using WebbleDash for yourself.

**THIS IS STILL AN ALPHA VERSION, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS PROJECT MAY CONTAIN BUGS**

## How to use WebbleDash

You can use WebbleDash by using the attribute data-wdash="[element_name]" on one of the supported elements for that element - [see cheat_cheat.txt for more info](../master/cheat_sheet.txt).

That's it! You are now a master at WebbleDash.
